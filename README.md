# Video-Anomaly-AE-Replication
Video-Anomaly-AE-Replication is a clean, modular reproduction of a spatiotemporal autoencoder for unsupervised video anomaly detection. The model learns normal spatial structures and their temporal evolution using convolutional encoders and ConvLSTM layers, detecting anomalies through reconstruction error.
